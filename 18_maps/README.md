# MAPS!

## Notes:

This lesson has a few bugs still -- if you find them, please add to the issues.

* You need to download the ipynb file (the raw file) and run it on your own machine (via ipython notebook) to view the whole thing.
  
* You'll also need to change the name of the html map files that you render to view them inline each time.
