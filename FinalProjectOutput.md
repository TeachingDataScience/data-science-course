# Final Project Output

## Developer Notebook

The developer notebook includes the full code and output of your work, in an organized fashion.  This can server as a reference for yourself, for other coders, and for future students, as an example or 'how to' for doing the analyses that you completed or worked towards.

It should include markdown headers for each section, and all code should be commented or explained with markdown cells.

Feel free to err on the side of inclusion, in terms of code snippets, plots and explanation.

You might want to include (paste in) the headings from your client-facing notebook as well.




## Client-Facing Notebook

A clean notebook notebook with text, code and images which could be understood by a reader such as yourself prior to taking this course.  Include as many images as you can, provided you include a brief explanation of them or they are self explanatory.  Feel free to include code, but ensure that it is explained via text.  There is no need to include all of the code, as that will be present in the developer notebook.

### Motivation

* A paragraph or two describing in words what the work you're describing.
* Feel free to include any images or plots that help.

### Data Acquisition and Exploration

* How did you describe your dataset?  Include all exploratory plots.  What was interesting about it?

### Analyses Performed

#### Analysis 1
